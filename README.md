This repo contains a few competitive programming problems I have saved over the years.

However, most practice sites (such as LeetCode) use an online IDE, so I don't have the source code downloaded.
Also, my naming convention for real problems are the letter for time efficiency, so I am not uploading most of the "A.cpp", "B.cpp", etc. either as that would clutter this page
